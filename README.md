# Moroccans authors of top AI conferences
This is a curated list of Moroccans publishing in the most prestigious AI conferences

Currently, only NeurIPS is considered but there are plans to include also ICML and ICLR

We are looking for contributors and anyone who would like to help maintain this list, please use pull requests *after having carefully read* the following remarks:
* We only consider papers published in *the main track* of NeurIPS as it is the most competitive track (i.e. not from workshops/datsets/affinity tracks)
* We prefer if the authors themeselves open the pull request, so before suggesting to add a paper please take some time to ask the authors if they are willing to do this themselves

For any question, correction or remark please contact team@morocco.ai

# MoroccoAI prize for Morocco-affiliated authors of NeurIPS

At MoroccoAI we love to push boundaries, break glass ceilings and encourage world class AI research by Moroccans. As much as we are very proud of all the Moroccans publishing in top AI conferences, at the same time we investigate and think about the reasons for the near zero contributions from Morocco-based researchers. As we acknowledge the challenges of conducting cutting edge AI research with limited resources, we believe that it is still possible to publish in areas that do not need millions of dollars and compute power. Please refer to the valuable discussion at the end of the MoroccoAI conference keynote by Dr. Samy Bengio.

This is why we are excited to announce a financial prize of 500$ for every NeurIPS paper accepted in the main track with at least one author from a **Morocco-based affiliation** starting NeurIPS 2024. 

This prize must be seen as a token of gratitude and appreciation for advancing AI science at the highest level and encouraging and inspiring others to push their work and challenge it with the brightest minds in AI.

## Rules 

* To be eligible for the prize, the publication must have at least one co-author with a Morocco-based affiliation among the first three authors.
* The prize is delivered directly to the Morocco-affiliated authors of the publication. The choice is theirs if they would like to share the prize with the rest of the authors. They are responsible for their choice.
* One author can benefit from a maximum of two prizes if they co-author two eligible papers.  
* If you succeded and are eligible to the prize, please fill the following form
